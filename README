Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.


Assignment 1 
============
Step1: Identify the tables for the remaining 4 VMX configuration MSR's
Step2: Create a struct for each MSR with the correct array siz and values
Step3: Read each MSR and call the report_capability function for each with the corresponding parameters.

The report_capability function is a generic function which takes the struct, length of the struct, lo and hi
as its parameter. It will print each capability of the given struct.

The script/module required for this assignment is placed at https://github.com/akshay-sjsu-173/linux/blob/master/scripts/cmpe283-1.c
In order to execute this, perform the following steps:
Step1: Clone github repo or download the module.
Step2: Run the command "make"
Step 3: Run "sudo insmod cmpe283-1.ko". This will install the module.
Step 4: Run "dmesg" to check the output.

Sample Output is as follows:
